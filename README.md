# VolumeWindowZoom

This Xcode project demonstrates how to scale a volume to correctly account for
changes to the visionOS Window Zoom setting.

For a complete description of the issue addressed by this project, see

The code that resizes the volume's contents is in the file [ScaledBoxVolumeContentView.swift](VolumeWindowZoom/ScaledBoxVolumeContentView.swift).
