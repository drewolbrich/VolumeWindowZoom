# VolumeWindowZoom

This visionOS project demonstrates how to scale a volume's contents to correctly account for changes to the user's Window Zoom setting.

For a complete description of the issue addressed by this project, see  [https://www.lunarskydiving.com/blog/volume-window-zoom](https://www.lunarskydiving.com/blog/volume-window-zoom).

The code that resizes the volume's contents is in the file [ScaledBoxVolumeContentView.swift](VolumeWindowZoom/ScaledBoxVolumeContentView.swift).
